# sticker-scatter
A js script to randomly scatter stickers (or whatever images you want) across your website. :)
It'll give you a different scatter pattern on refresh each time.

I made this for my neocities site. There's a bunch of stickers for you to use in the /stickers/ folder to get started, and an example html page with everything combined that you can just copy/paste if you want. Some potential uses would be to show off different collections in a chaotic way, like your favourite trading cards, or coins, or stamps or whatever. Alternatively, you could use it to build background elements in your layouts that change each time. Idk! Have fun!!
